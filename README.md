# Obstacle Detection and Recognition System using Customized YOLO Algorithm for a Mobile Robot
## ENPM673 - Perception for Autonomous Robots

## Dependencies
1. python 3.11 (any version above 3 should work)
2. Python running IDE (I used VS Code)

## Libraries
1. OpenCV
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib
4. Ultralytics
5. PiCamera

## Contents
- Codes
    - Pi
        - Utils
        - Stream_Obstacle_Avoidance.py
    - Obstacle Detection.ipynb
    - final_weight.pt
- Datasets

## Installation Instructions
1. Download the zip file and extract it.
2. Install python and the required dependencies: pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib ultralytics
3. Open $Obstacle Detection.ipynb$ from the Codes folder and run the cells sequentially.
4. Use the final_weight.pt file to run our model
5. Run the codes in Codes/Pi in Raspberry Pi
